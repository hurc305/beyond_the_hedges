Houston was established in 1836 by August and John Allen for $5,000 in pursuit of wealth. The city established a ward system in the mid 1840s after Houston was charted “to have city representatives reflect their constituents” [qtd. in Kever, “Pride lives on in Houston’s six historical wards."](http://www.chron.com/life/article/Pride-lives-on-in-Houston-s-six-historical-wards-1990735.php) Wards were geographically divided into four sections, intersecting at Congress and Main Street. “They really were mixed societies in the early days,” historian Betty Chapman claims, “where your worked dictated where you lived, not who you wanted to live around.” [qtd. in Kever.](http://www.chron.com/life/article/Pride-lives-on-in-Houston-s-six-historical-wards-1990735.php)

In 1876, two additional wards were created as Houston continued to expanded in population and land acquisition. Houston’s Third Ward is one of six historic wards located in the southeast region. ![Houston's ward system in 1913](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3d/MapHouston1913.jpg)

Ultimately, political and economic corruption surfaced in the wards, leading to their demise in 1915. [Schafer, “Looking back wards."](http://www.houstontx.gov/savvy/archives/win08/win08_heritage.htm) Although wards remain in local Houstonian vocabulary for the past 100 years, historian Betty Chapman challenges local disconnections of space and place because “people might think they live in the Third Ward. No, they don’t. They might live where the Third Ward might have been, but they don’t live in the ward because there are no wards.” Local rhetoric signifies the social and cultural identity of the wards ingrained into the geographic landscape of the city. ![Houston's ward system in 1920](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/HoustonWards1920.jpg)

To manage urban sprawl, the city government divided Houston into 88 _super neighborhoods_ for local communities to connect and address the challenges and concerns in their geographic area (Thomas and Murray, 1991). Physical barriers of these communities are natural, such as as Brays and Buffalo Bayou, and man-made, including infrastructure. Shaped by highways and politicians, today, the Third Ward super neighborhood is defined as a space inside of the loop between Highway 288 and Interstate 45. These super neighborhoods elicit distinct racial patterns, socioeconomic landscapes and resources, representing the geographic relationship between urban inequality and space.

The Third Ward is historically the largest and one of the most disadvantaged concentrations of black residents in Houston (Carrasco, 8). When white families moved out of the central city after the Civil War era, former slaves moved into the Third Ward to become factory workers, bus drivers, mechanics and masons, shaping the social landscape experienced today (Wilson, 31). As a cultural entity, black residents in the Third Ward formed present notions of the community by building their own iconic shotgun homes and developing acres of land for education, worship and recreation. Residents’ sense of place within the Third Ward promoted the development of black educational institutions from elementary schools to universities including Texas Southern University, founded to educate and empower black students in Houston.  [Kever, “Pride lives on in Houston’s six historical wards.”](http://www.chron.com/life/article/Pride-lives-on-in-Houston-s-six-historical-wards-1990735.php) Emancipation Park was originally built as a social space for slaves and now serves as a memorial space to celebrate Juneteenth and freedom (Wilson, 34). Residents are proud of their culture and history; however, Third Ward residents’ power and capabilities are diminishing due to the city’s dependency on highways and land developers. Local allocations of power redefine residents' sense of place and social value to their space in Houston.

Houston’s political economy historically exploits resources and monopolizes business opportunities through uncontrollable growth and limited government regulations (Kleinberg, 2). Land developers and automobiles drove white Houstonians out of the central city and into suburbia, constructing highways along the way to connect space and mobilize people within metropolitan places. 

Houston’s highways represent the American Dream. A network of structures, highways build social capacity to incorporate space for residential, commercial, agricultural and economic expansion. Mobilization between spaces creates access to not only what people need, but what they want. Highways catalyze the opportunity for residents to live in one space and work in another, to attend school in one space but socialize miles away, to visit a museum and grocery shop in the same day. Houston is dependent on cars because of the size and creation of single-use spaces. However, as with the American Dream, highways are disconnected from reality because the majority of residents in inner city spaces are not the benefactors of highways. The city systematically deems automobiles as a tool and barrier of physical and social mobility to opportunities around the city. Consequently, the method to achieve the American Dream in Houston is by paying the toll price.

Highways in Houston are visual class barriers; affluent residents live in super neighborhoods to the west and disadvantaged residents live toward the east. Not only are highways agents in constructing socioeconomic landscapes, but also act as physical barriers inside a community. Texas State Highway 288 connected suburbia with downtown, but disconnected the Third Ward with itself. 

The highway acts as a _transparent gate_ between urban poverty and urban development. According to [Houston’s Planning Development Department] (http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/Demographics/super_neighborhoods.html) as of 2012, 65 percent of residents are black and 54 percent have an income of under $25,000. 30 percent of homes are vacant and 27 percent of residents do not have a high school diploma. On the other side of Highway 288 is Museum Park, a super neighborhood that is also known as the Museum District and considered a part of the Third Ward before 1915. However, in Museum Park, only 16 percent of residents are black and 75 percent of residents have an income over $25,000.  While similar to the Third Ward, 29 percent of housing units are vacant, but 75 percent of residents have at least a high school diploma. These communities are demographically polarized, exemplifying the broader division between the east and west sides of Houston. Automobile dependency prompts the necessity for gated driveways in residential spaces and enclaves disadvantaged residents in urban spaces.

Gentrification in the Third Ward is inevitable; however, its impact on the community remains questionable and divided. Income and education attainment are rising at the cost of displacing local residents due to increasing property taxes and demand for centrally located housing. [Feldman, “Third Ward: The epicenter of Houston’s fight for racial equality.”](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/life/article/Third-Ward-The-epicenter-of-Houston-s-fight-for-5706658.php) Social safety nets for disadvantaged populations in Houston are limited in local and state policy. Current debates including environmental racism, overwhelming criminalization of minorities and urban renewal call distributive and procedural justice in Houston into question. Third Ward residents face barriers to entry in jobs, education, grocery stores and other factors perpetuating poverty, all which stem from access to transportation. Protecting local residents from displacement requires social safety nets that _cover_ the needs and challenges of disadvantaged communities to ensure justice and equity.

The Third Ward can be inappropriately stereotyped as a “ghetto” neighborhood with filthy streets and unruly crime. A 2013 study by [NeighborhoodScout.com] (http://www.chron.com/homes/article/Two-Houston-neighborhoods-called-most-dangerous-4476367.php) ranks neighborhoods within the Third Ward as the _15th most dangerous_ neighborhoods in the country. [ The study also claims that _1 in 13 residents_ are at risk of being a victim of crime each year, dispelling attitudes of fear from outside residents. However, society criminalizes the identity of the community without considering sociologically, external factors aggravating criminal activity.

Actors with power redefine places for economic and political gains within social spaces (Lefebvre 57). Highways perpetuate inequality as those with power decided the structure of the highway  system _regardless_ of the perspective of central city residents. An automobile dependent city enriches the lives of the affluent, but constrains the lives of the disadvantaged. The asymmetric relationship of power catalyzes a class struggle by literally mobilizing those with power and disenfranchising those without it. As the geographic landscape of the Third Ward changed overtime because of the highway system, so did residents’ voices in local urban renewal. Highways, man-made symbols of social capital and power, drain out the voices of lower classes by the sounds of privileged businessmen and women in their Mercedes-Benzes angrily honking their horns during five o’clock traffic. 

It is a crime to steal someone’s vehicle, but why is it not a crime to force disadvantaged communities to depend on automobile ownership?  Why is it not a crime to derive physical mobility from socioeconomic mobility?  Why is it not a crime to institutionally isolate residents based on race and class?  Or, is it?

My research explores the impact of Houston as an auto-dependent city by analyzing where cars are parked in residential spaces within the Greater Third Ward. I compared residential parking based on three factors: location of the car (street, paved driveway, grass, garage), covered versus uncovered and gated versus not gated. To analyze residential parking for each housing unit, I used the “Street View” tool on Google Maps. Each point represents one housing unit or style; therefore, not every point represents one home but can also represent a row of uniformed homes. Many points that visualize more than one home are rows of apartments and shotgun homes, one of the oldest forms of housing in the United States. Over the course of this assignment, I mapped 2,700 units of residential parking throughout the super neighborhood as of December, 2015.

					<h1>Houston's Lindy Hop Embassies</h1>
					<h2>Lindy Hop's Roles and Origins on a Personal, Regional, and Global Level</h2>
					<h3>By Thomas Williamson</h3>

				<div id=essay>
					<p class=paragraph>It's no wonder that I began dancing Lindy Hop at 17, one year after managing to obtain my driver's license. Past the age of 16 in our culture, you enter into a time in your life where freedom and independence mean everything. This is why a driver's license is so traditionally sought after by so many American teenagers. I would argue that Lindy Hop too, from its historical roots and still today, is, like driving, an activity that inspires and provides personal freedom and independence in more ways than one.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>Lindy Hop is a dance with branches and roots in every time and place since it was first born. To give some historical perspective, Lindy Hop was an energetic and athletic dance that was danced in Harlem's Savoy Ballroom to jazz music which was first publicly recognized in 1928 (Spring 184) . Developed as a combination of several prior forms of jazz dance, Lindy Hop's "complex rhythmical structures, and origination by African American artists, [has made it] distinguished from the [other dances] by its infinite gradations of complexity, ranging from the most "social" of social dances to one of the most dynamic and rhythmically intricate stage dances ever devised" (Monaghan 124). Because of its unique energy and potential, by the 1930s and 40s, Lindy Hop had spread to the nation's people and music. You'll notice in many films and media about the World War II era will have Lindy Hop or "jitterbug" dancing in the background of social scenes.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>Regarding its birth, Lindy Hop already had an essence of freedom about it. Some like Kendra Unruh, in her paper From Kitchen Mechanics to "Jubilant Spirits of Freedom": Black, Working-Class Women Dancing the Lindy Hop, argue that Lindy Hop "provided a means of escape, freedom, and rebellion for Black, working-class women during the swing era" (Uhruh 213). In a time when the holds of racism were much stronger than today, Lindy Hop allowed women of color to "reclaim their bodies for the use of pleasure rather than for the use of work set forth by the Black and White middle-class" (Uhruh 219). Not only this, but the Lindy Hop community created back then (and still today) a culture of tolerance, acceptance, and integration. The aforementioned Savoy ballroom, the home of Lindy Hop from its 1926 opening (Spring 184) to its 1943 closure (Monaghan 126) had an integrated and accepting atmosphere. On the atmosphere of the Savoy Ballroom, Howard Spring writes: </p>
					<p class=inline-quote>It attracted large crowds consisting of a wide variety of people: African Americans and European Americans, the social and economic elite, the middle class, blue-collar workers, Harlemites, and tourists. The inclusiveness of the Savoy made it easy for people from different social classes, geographic regions, and ethno-cultural backgrounds to experience the Lindy hop and its music first-hand. (Spring 184-5)</p>
					<p class=paragraph>The Savoy Ballroom and its dancers continued to be a beacon for the swing community and jazz culture until its closure, having a tremendous effect on the dancing, film, and music for years to come. The most evident example of its effect on the music of the era is the incredibly popular swing song "Stompin' at the Savoy" (see media section). Some good examples of Savoy and Lindy dancer's impacts on film include Frankie Manning's choreography in Hellzapoppin' (1941) (see media section), which modern Lindy Hoppers still universally praise, and some mock Lindy Hop dancing in Toy Story 3 (2010) (see media section).</p>
					<p class=paragraph>Continuing on from the 1940s, the popularity of Lindy Hop dipped as different types of music took hold of the public until the 1990s, when the acrobatic and energetic nature got Lindy Hop a foot in the door to becoming popular again. This resurgence of Lindy Hop became known to the community as the "swing revival" and is often associated with and characterized by (but not begun by) a popular GAP commercial commonly entitled "Khakis Swing" (see media section). The popularity of Lindy Hop since the swing revival has only risen and continues to increase today. Today, Lindy Hop events and dances are common (and more popular than people would think) in many countries around the world, most prominently in the United States, Canada, Sweden, France, and South Korea.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>From an unstructured dance only at the Savoy Ballroom in 1928 into a multinational network of knowledge and events in 2015, Lindy Hop has promoted a culture of energy, tolerance, and freedom to dancers in its community.</p>
					<br></br>
					<p class=paragraph>I, naturally, began dancing in just one on the places in the now globally-scaled Lindy Hop network, Houston, Texas. Being relatively young and wanting to take advantage of my newfound mobility and sense of independence, I had the pleasure of allowing Lindy Hop to help lead me to new experiences, new people, and new places around the city. Lindy Hop and its role in Houston is easier to visualize with the understanding of all the different venues and places to dance around the city. Each of these venues has its own people, environment, and role in the Lindy Hop scene in Houston and has helped shape my perspective and helps define for me the space that is Houston.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>As the Savoy Ballroom was the home to Lindy Hop in its early days in the space of America as a whole, the Eldorado Ballroom is the home to Lindy Hop in the space of Houston. It is the home-base for the Houston Swing Dance Society (HSDS), the Houston Hepcats (HSDS's performance team), and for my dancing, as I first started dancing at the Eldorado Ballroom. For me and for many others, Eldorado is the central point in Houston for Lindy Hop dancing. It wasn't the central point until just recently though.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>Before Eldorado became the go-to location for Lindy Hop in Houston, Houston Swing Dance Society was based at a venue called The Melody Club, on the west side of Houston.  The Melody Club, after HSDS's founding in 1997(hsds.org), hosted the HSDS Lindy Hop dances until June of 2013, when it closed down and HSDS moved to Eldorado. The moving of HSDS to Eldorado brought more Lindy Hop inside the 610 loop and led to the booking of venues and events nearer to Downtown Houston.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>In regards to HSDS's founding in 1997, the organization was founded in order to host a dance workshop with Lindy Hop legend Frankie Manning. The workshop was popular and became a yearly event. In 1999, the event was renamed to Lindyfest(hsds.org) and has been going on ever since. Today, Lindyfest, now one of the top 5 largest Lindy Hop events in the nation, takes place in the March of every year at the Royal Sonesta Hotel in Houston, by the west side of the major loop of Houston, Interstate Highway 610. Interestingly, as 610 acts as a funnel for those inside the city of Houston, Lindyfest acts as a funnel for Lindy Hop dancers both inside and outside the country. This also connects with Houston in another way, seeing as Houston is such a diverse and international city. This mirrors Lindyfest for its international qualities but also its representation of its tolerance and acceptance that have stayed with Lindy Hop since its very beginnings. Speaking personally, I feel like participating in Lindy Hop events such as Lindyfest and even just being a part of the Lindy Hop scene within Houston has opened me up far more to the wide range of spaces and homes and centers and cultures that Houston as a city has to offer.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>In discussing these spaces that Houston offers, it is interesting to see how different regions of Houston, viewed in the context of Lindy Hop activity, appear to either mirror or juxtapose the activity that one would expect of the same space as a Houston native. For example, we saw that Lindyfest at the Royal Sonesta Hotel greatly mirrored Houston's status as a diverse and international city. Examining this relationship between Houston's Lindy Hop activity and its expected activity is how we can truly see the role of these venues as "Lindy Hop Embassies" to Houston's different regions.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>The Lindy Hop venues in the Downtown area of Houston (including Downtown itself and its surrounding neighborhoods) play an interesting dynamic with the space of Houston as a whole. The Downtown area is full of lively venues that either serve food and drinks or are part of a building that does. The lively atmosphere characterized the Midtown, Montrose, and Downtown areas well. Interestingly, the central point of Houston's Lindy Hop scene, Eldorado Ballroom, is in the Greater Third Ward. Even with the towering skyscapers of Houston's Downtown not far from view, being part of the Lindy Hop scene in Houston makes it easy to think that the Third Ward is truly the heart of the city.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>The Heights is a particularly good example in which the juxtaposition between the Lindy Hop scene activity and the expected activity of the same space for a native Houstonian is strong. As a native Houstonian, the Heights is seen as one of the most cultured regions of Houston, hosting a variety of iconic art projects, being the go-to spot for all kinds of interesting dining options, and of course where Lights in the Heights takes place yearly. Comparatively, The Heights is a dead-zone in the Lindy Hop scene, only inactive practice venues for the Houston Hepcats lying within. A good explanation for this surprising juxtiposition is that dance venues tend to rely on spacious commercial establishments, which are somewhat of a rarity in the heavily residential Houston Heights.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>The Lindy Hop venues of West Houston as an interesting mirror for the space of Houston. The Lindy Hop venues in West Houston consist of a few practice spaces, workshop locations, and social dancing spots that gain some popularity once or twice a year that are interspersed throughout the area. As urbanized Houston spreads out to the more suburban West, so do the dancing venues.</p>
					<p class=paragraph>Lindy Hop gave a sense of personal and bodily freedom to those who first danced it in the 30s and 40s. As we see, the Lindy Hop venues of Houston can tell us stories, give new character to the space of Houston, and give those who participate in the Lindy Hop community in Houston a spacial freedom of their own in exploring, experiencing, and re-examining different cultures, places, and interests around the city.</p>

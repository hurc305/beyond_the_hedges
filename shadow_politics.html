Almost 75 years ago, Clarence Darrow of the ACLU said “When I was a boy I was told that anybody could become President; I'm beginning to believe it,” and in 1941 it appeared to be true. Sadly we no longer find ourselves in the political atmosphere of the mid 20th century, and rather in a polarized America held between a red elephant on one side and a blue donkey on the other. The United States today finds itself stuck in a political quagmire, where congress spends far too long arguing back and forth over issues that should be common sense but rather have become partisan battlegrounds. In this highly divided world of blue and red, one would think to look for alternatives to the struggle, other political parties to express the views of a disgruntled and mis-represented citizenry. Sadly, the options are slim. This is not due to a lack of trying, but rather due to institutionalized barriers and cultural norms that support the red-blue duopoly, leaving green, and yellow politics, and their supporters, in the shadows.

Peering past the towering Republican elephant and Democrat donkey, you find a land of shadow politics and grassroots activism. Houston, Texas, known for its meandering bayous and rowdy rodeos makes an excellent case study. Starting in the roots of a city like Houston is easy, for the soil is loose and loamy and the people, ready for change. Tired of the grossly inaccurate political picture painted by mainstream media, cultural norms, and the two party system, Houstonians have begun to make their diverse political voices heard. For too long has Texas been an assumed “red” state, and Houston a “blue” city, yet Harris County supports Green and Libertarian parties. While it may seem as if the two party system towers above the so-called “lesser” parties, and resistance is a futile “wasted vote,” Houstonians still continue to raise support for their plethora of causes. Houston is one of the most diverse cities on Earth in race, culture, jobs, languages, and stories, why shouldn’t it be one in politics as well? Houston doesn’t just have its supporters of the two “mainstream” third parties, but has websites and organizations dedicated to chapters of both the Constitution and the Tea Parties, as well as a slew of regional parties, including the Harris County Reform Party, the Texas Populist Party, and the Harris County League of Women Voters. A plethora of views exist, yet many are never heard of, let alone represented.

The support certainly exists though however. All throughout Houston there is significant support for both the Green party and the Libertarian party. The west side of Houston, finds itself mostly Libertarian, with support from the rather expectedly conservative West University and River Oaks neighborhoods, but also, rather unexpectedly, from universities such as U of H and Rice, Upper Kirby, and the Montrose area. It appears as if many conservative voters, unhappy with their position in an almost guaranteed Democrat district, chose to send their vote to a third party in defiance of the two party system.

The eastern side of Houston holds the Green supporter base, with many suburbs and sections of the second and third wards voting Green. Overall, there is less support for the Green party throughout Houston, an unexpected development across such a preconceived “liberal” city. In addition, many partisan assumptions are turned on their heads, including the voting habits of universities, predominantly LGBTQ areas, suburbs, and low socioeconomic areas. These assumptions are all aspects of the shadows cast down upon Houston, and America by the two party system.

A grave injustice has been built into the American people’s psyche and culture by the establishment parties. Roadblocks on the path of third-party representation are ever present, and highly hinderous to prospective third party voters and candidates. Unreasonable requirements and ridiculous amounts of paperwork exist to merely get your name on the ballot as a non-establishment candidate, rules regarding how much money you can raise, in conjunction with the lack of financial support awarded to major parties, and the lack of equal media coverage cripple third party campaigns. Single-member, majoritarian electoral districts allow for only a single victor, and require a party’s platform to be broad enough for success. The larger parties had noticed this trend in broadening, and through co-optation, have aggressively  absorbed the policies of any third-party candidates that even approach electability. These institutional hurdles, in addition to the lack of resources, legitimacy, legacy, and track record inherently associated with third party campaigns effectively prevent the rise of a third party within the United States, (Caiazzo and Marsh, 2011).
	This illusion of free choice that the Republicrats have cast over the electorate’s eyes has certainly worked, as trends in voting tracked from 1950 onwards show that regardless of who runs, what the platform is, or how poorly the establishment candidates perform, the percentage of change in voters who defect from the main parties borders on the insignificant, (Bruce, 1992). It is counterproductive and dangerous to merely accept these institutions and customs as irrefutable facts and traditions, and immediate steps towards solvency must be taken. When tackling problems of policy and culture, action starts from the bottom of the system, with the citizenry and the average person. Grassroots change is key, as policy makers whom chose to work with the citizenry rather than for the citizenry have more successful and long-lasting policies, (Laws and Forester, 2015).
As in any democracy, some of this issue stems from the tyranny of the majority, and some of it is just a numbers game. Not all causes appeal to a wide portion of voters. Yet a much more significant portion of the problem arises from the culture and institution surrounding the electoral process in America. Part of it is our fault in the way we view political space. Through years of media conditioning, quantitative rather than qualitative analysis, and disproportionate visualization, our concept of political space is red or blue, or at best, a mixed shade of purple. Third parties both literally and figuratively don’t show up on the map. This is a large reason why beyond the rather inexcusable Green Party, the average reader would have a hard time generating the colors of say the Constitution, Libertarian or Populist party. 
Numbers do not necessarily legitimize an opinion. For the longest time, policies such as freedom from England, slavery, and heteronormative marriage were unpopular, and only held in the minority viewpoint. While the world around us begs to be quantified, processed, and analyzed, voices, stories, and minority opinions are lost with each and every step. While the politics of a democracy require quantifiable numbers to function, the very process of gathering these numbers inhibits democracy. Rather than portraying the usual red-blue Houston, Texas, or America, the first steps in total political recognition can start with us opening our minds up to a world of many different colors and political views. By helping to change our culture and perspectives on the issue of partisan politics, grassroots action will take hold, and we can grow a better future for us all.

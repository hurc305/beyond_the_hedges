#Introduction

##### 0
The proximity of ethnic foods, support the preservation and promotion of a distinctive ethnic, religious or cultural heritage.  In this case, the kosher eateries and groceries in southwest Houston support the Jewish community.  In the aftermath of the major flooding in 2015, many question the sustainability of the Jewish neighborhood due to changes in its infrastructure including access to kosher food.  Food security “exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” with the four pillars of food security being availability, access, utilization, and stability (FAO, 2009).  This definition can be seen through the lenses of cultural and religious food requirements, rather than strictly access to basic nutrients.   As experienced during the Houston flood, Jews who follow kosher observances could be considered temporarily food insecure due to the destruction and displacement of their homes and kosher food businesses in their neighborhood. 

#Food Identity in Urban Areas

Bangers and mash.  Fish tacos. Sourdough bread.  Crab chowder.  Jambalaya.  Mint Julep. These foods quickly bring to mind locations and peoples’ food histories and preferences across the diverse cultures in the United States.  Foods selection and preparation form a part of an individual and people’s culture, history and identity.  It often solidifies a regional cultural identity and reflects the preferences and norms of immigrant communities.  Food production historically reflected the resources available in a given area, whereas its preparation reflects the society’s history and culture.  As ethnic and cultural groups move to new areas, food items and their preparations are shared and their histories become intermingled into the local culture.  We are what we eat.  Specialty foods become emblematic and symbolic of a region, and are intermeshed with history.  
In the United States, neighborhoods developed as immigrants clustered with those of similar national origins and cultures due to urban policy at the time or personal preference. The language, foods and religious cultural identification bridge homelands and support transitions to American life.  Food availability in the tightly knit immigrant communities supports a shared way of life.  

Ethnic identity and definition of place are associated with food consumption.  The preparation and consumption of food provides a means for expressing an abstract significance of social systems and cultural values (Murcott, 1982).  What people eat and drink reflect their social identities and their membership of social groups.  Eating habits are a product of codes of conduct and the structure of social relations of the society in which they occur.  Kalcik (1984), suggests the relationship between food and groups have a double function: “1) to maintain the cohesion of the society and of groups within it; 2) to determine, in part, the relation of the individual to the society and to the smaller groups within it.”   Further, with ethnic groups in the United States, “it can be seen that food style is not based on geography and/or economics alone, but becomes a means of self-identity as well as group membership card.”

  Jews who follow kosher laws are fulfilling their religious observance, which also forms and builds ethnic identity.  They rely on a functioning kosher community to adhere to kosher-approved food selection and preparation.  Kosher dietary laws are followed year round, not only at particular holiday or festive occasions. Certain meats may not be eaten, others are allowed but must be prepared according to Jewish ethical practices.  Other rules have to do with the separation of meat and milk. These kosher laws greatly restrict the ability to eat in public restaurants, and therefore, kosher food stores and eateries are highly sought after for those who follow kosher religious observances.  While kosher observances may have decreased over the last century following the general trend of assimilation of Jews, it is worth noting that American Millennials are found to follow the kosher laws at a much higher rate than Baby Boomers (Goren, 2014).

#Jews in Houston

Houston’s Jewish community dates from the earliest founding of the city, with a number of European immigrant merchants arriving in the mid-1800s who became major contributors to the economic success of the city.  Jews built the city through their successful businesses and community leadership including the Battlestein, Foley, Sakowitz and Weingarten families, as well as Ben Taub, Mitchell Westheimer, Henry Dannenbaum  and countless others.  Jewsish students were at Rice from its founding.
 ![photo] (https://ricehistorycorner.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/menorah-society-1916.jpg)

The Jewish population of Houston grew through the post-war era, and experienced rapid growth in the 1970s and 1980s.  Most Jews lived in the southwestern part of the city, with half residing in Meyerland, Braeswood and Bellaire.  From the 1980s, Jews, also extended into the suburbs, including Spring, Humble, and the Woodlands (GWISJL).   Today, approximately fifty Jewish temples, synagogues or other religious organizations exist across the Houston metro area, according to the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston. 

There is a symbiotic relationship between kosher food establishments and Jewish neighborhoods.  They need each other to thrive and survive.  Following the establishment of Houston’s Jewish neighborhoods primarily in Southwest part of the city, Houston has a number of thriving kosher businesses located there.  Kosher restaurants primarily serve those who follow kosher laws, but do not restrict their customer base.  In order to be economically viable, however, they are located in neighborhoods with a substantial number of Jewish residents, and typically owned and operated by residents in the community.


#Memorial Day Flood and its Impacts

On May 25-26, 2015, a major storm and flood devastated much of the state of Texas.  The Houston area received up to 10 inches of rain in a 24 hour period.  In addition to the rain, the southwest part of Houston was inundated when the Brays Bayou overflowed its banks.  Hundreds of homes and businesses were ruined and families evacuated.   A few lives were lost.  

At noon, May 26th, the Houston emergency management coordinator, Rick Flanagan reported that, “virtually every part of the city was affected by floodwaters, most notably central and southwest Houston” and “fire crews responded to about 530 water rescues overnight, mostly from people stranded in their vehicles.  At least 2,500 abandoned vehicles are strewn about the city from drivers seeking higher ground.” Further, he said that about 50,000 residents were without power late Tuesday morning, down from the 150,000 around midnight.  (AP, 2015)  An estimated 4,000 properties were significantly damaged.

Both Congregation Beth Israel and the United Orthodox Synagogue were heavily flooded.  Given the proximity of the Jewish religious and kosher food establishments to the Jewish neighborhoods in southwest Houston, the Jewish community was significantly impacted in multiple ways by the Memorial Day flood.

The accompanying map depicts the locations of all Kosher restaurants and groceries listed on the Houston Kashruth Association and Torch, Connecting Jews & Judaism websites.  Some Jewish house of worship and community centers located in southwest Houston are also included on the map.  The Meyerland neighborhood boundary is represented as a blue polygon, and flooded areas in southwest Houston appears in red.

The flood of May, 2015, may have created challenges to the sustainability of the kosher businesses and Jewish community due to direct impacts of the flood as well as temporary or permanent relocation of the population.  Many homes are still in the process of repair or are being sold.  One grocery with significant kosher selection, the HEB at Chimney Rock, was completely closed for many months following the floods.  It was not determined if any others had also closed for any significant periods of time. 
 ![photo](http://thebuzzmagazines.com/sites/default/files/article-photos/2015/05/flood%204.jpg) 

The predominance of the Jewish community is centered in the southwestern part of Houston.   The floods forced many families to temporarily relocate while their houses are being repaired.   Others are permanently moving to neighborhoods on higher ground.  The economic impacts of these relocations on the food establishments can not be underestimated.  The scattering/dispersal of the Jewish population away from the flood prone neighborhoods in the southwest side, may require the Jewish food establishments to move in order to stay in business or force them to close due to reduced revenues.  The economic and cultural long term effects on the Jewish community may not be known for some time.  The proximity of kosher eateries and groceries in southwest Houston, in addition to the synagogues and temples, support the preservation and promotion of the distinctive and stable Jewish cultural heritage in Houston.  If the neighborhood infrastructure disappears, how will the community remain viable?
